# Responsive Dashboard with Sliders and Music Player

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/ecemgo/pen/MWxjXeq](https://codepen.io/ecemgo/pen/MWxjXeq).

This pen has a responsive dashboard with sliders and a built-in music player. With the music player, you can easily skip songs or play them on a loop. Plus, each song comes with its album cover, and there's a record player effect with a rotating animation. And when you explore the artists, albums, and songs sections, each image has a hover effect. This pen is all about making the dashboard fun!

Note: Please, do not use it in profit-making platforms and projects without permission.
